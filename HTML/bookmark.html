<h1 id="computer">COMPUTER</h1>
<h6><a href="#overview">GO TO TOP</h6></a>
<p> A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem</p>
<h4 id="cpu">cpu</h4>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also reffered to as a central processor unit is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer by performing the basic arithmetical, logical and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.</p>
<h4 id="alu">ALU</h4>
<p>In computing, an arithmetic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central proceesing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphic processing units(GPUs) accommodate very powerful and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</p>
<h1 id="pl">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
<h6><a href="#overview">GO TO TOP</h6></a>
<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
<h4 id="c">C</h4>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
<h4 id="c++">C<sup>++</sup></h4>
<p>C++ (pronounces c plus plus) is a programming language that is general purpose, statically typed, free from, multi paradigm and compiled it is regarded as intermediate-level language, as it comprises both high level and low level language features.</p>
<h1 id="dbms">DBMS</h1>
<h6><a href="#overview">GO TO TOP</h6></a>
<p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.</p>
<h4 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h4>
<p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model.</p>
<h4 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h4>
<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>
<h4 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h4>
<p>HDBMS (Hierarchical Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that supports a hierarchical data model. Example HDBMS Systems: Lotus Notes (the most popular HDBMS in use today) IMS - IBM's Information Management System (first HDBMS).</p>

<h4 id="nwdbms">NWDBMS</h4>
<p>A DBMS is said to be Network DBMS, when it organizes the data in a network structure. As you all are aware that, a network may have as many connections as it can.
In our DBMS language, we can say that a parent can have many children and a child can have more than one parent. So a Network DBMS will have many-to-many relationship.</p>
